\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary of Findings \& Future Work}

The GAM methodology and the \verb|GAMLSS| R package are a powerful way of exploring, explaining and forecasting data.
It has been highly instructive to use these tools and this assignment has demonstrated well the usefulness of these
techniques.

Part 3 of this report is not at the level I wanted to present.  There is more work to be done here
to better model the probability of default and to have the correct criteria to asses the goodness of
the models for forecasting default rates, rather than the riskiness of the client.
