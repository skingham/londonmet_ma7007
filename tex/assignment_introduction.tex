\section{Introduction}

This work demonstrates the practical application of the \verb|GAMLSS| package for exploring, explaining
and predicting data using sophisticated statistical and machine learning techniques.

The report is structured into three main sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model Selection}: Utilizing a Body Mass Index (BMI) data set, this section
  demonstrates the process of selecting the most appropriate statistical model using Generalized
  Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) techniques covered in the course.
\item \textbf{Centile Estimation}: This part focuses on estimating centiles from the handgrip (HG) strength data set,
  applying the methodologies discussed in the syllabus, particularly emphasizing the flexibility and
  utility of GAMLSS in handling complex distributions.
\item \textbf{Forecasting Application}: The final section will apply the acquired modeling skills to
  a new dataset (to be supplied), showcasing the ability to perform accurate forecasting and predictive
  analysis as a practical demonstration of the theoretical knowledge gained.
\end{itemize}

This structured approach not only reflects the course objectives but also demonstrates practical
competence in the use of advanced statistical techniques for effective data analysis and forecasting.
