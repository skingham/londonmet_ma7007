\section{Introduction}

Recently in the Harvard Business Review (HBR), \textcite{Coppersmith1997} identified the challenges regarding cyber-security oversight by company

\enquote{65\% of board members think their organization is at risk of a material cyber-attack, only 48\% of CISOs share that view.}
